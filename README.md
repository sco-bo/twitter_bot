## Twitter Bot

This is an implentation of the Jumpstart Labs Micro-Blogger. This Bot uses the Twitter API to allow the user to interact with Twitter via the Command Line. 

The bot allows the user to tweet and send direct message, 'spam' his/her followers with direct messages, retreive the last tweet of each follower, shorten URL's using Bit.ly, and tweet those shortened URL's.

Using the Klout API, it also determines a follower's Klout score.
